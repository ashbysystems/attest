# /attest:escalate

Guide the reviewer through creating an escalation record.

## Trigger

This command is called when:
- A reviewer selects "Escalated" for a question during `/attest:review` (called automatically)
- The reviewer runs `/attest:escalate` manually after a review

## Behaviour

### 1. Identify the escalated item

If called with a question number argument, use that question from the current review. If called without arguments during a review, use the question that was just marked as Escalated. If called manually outside a review, ask the reviewer which item they want to escalate and gather the context.

### 2. Capture escalation rationale (MANDATORY — do not skip)

You MUST ask the reviewer:

> Why does this item need escalation? Describe why this is outside your authority or expertise, or why it requires specialist input.

Capture their free-text response. Do not auto-generate the rationale. The reviewer must state in their own words why they are escalating.

### 3. Suggest escalation target

Based on the domain of the escalated item, suggest an appropriate role using the escalation-framework skill's role mapping table. You MUST suggest the domain-appropriate role first. Key mappings:

- Legal / contractual items → Senior legal counsel or head of legal
- Data protection / privacy items → Data Protection Officer (DPO)
- Financial / commercial items → CFO or head of finance
- Regulatory / compliance items → Compliance lead or regulatory affairs manager
- Technical / security items → CTO, CISO, or head of engineering

Present the suggestion clearly:

> **Suggested escalation target:** [Domain-appropriate role from the table above]
>
> This is a role suggestion based on the domain of this item. Who specifically in your organisation should handle this? You can accept this suggestion or specify a different role.

If the reviewer specifies a different role, record their choice. But always present the domain-appropriate suggestion first.

### 4. Suggest timeframe

Based on the risk level, suggest a resolution timeframe using the escalation-framework skill's timeframe table:

> **Suggested timeframe:** [e.g., "Within 24 hours"]
>
> This is based on the [risk level] risk classification. Adjust based on your organisational context.

The reviewer can accept or adjust.

### 5. Generate escalation record

Use the template at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/escalation-record.md` as the structure. Populate:

- Escalation date and time
- Related review log filename (if a review is in progress or just completed)
- Reviewer name and role (from the current review, or prompt if not available)
- Output type, source, risk classification
- Output fingerprint
- A 2-3 sentence summary of the reviewed output (write this from the output content, providing enough context for the escalation target)
- The specific escalated question and why it was surfaced
- The reviewer's escalation rationale
- Suggested target role and timeframe
- Resolution section left blank (populated by `/attest:resolve`)
- Disclaimer footer — MUST use this exact text:

> ---
>
> *This escalation record was generated by Attest (Ashby). Attest surfaced questions for the reviewer's consideration. All review decisions, assessments, and the final determination were made by the human reviewer named above. Attest does not provide legal, financial, or compliance advice and has made no quality judgment about the reviewed output.*

### 6. Save the file

Determine the save location:
1. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.config.json` for the configured save location
2. If not configured, use the current working directory

Save with this EXACT filename format (no exceptions):
```
attest-escalation-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-[item-ref].md
```

Where `[item-ref]` is a short kebab-case label derived from the escalated question topic. Examples:
- `attest-escalation-2026-02-15-14-45-dpf-certification.md`
- `attest-escalation-2026-02-15-14-45-liability-cap.md`
- `attest-escalation-2026-02-15-14-45-jurisdiction.md`

Do NOT use formats like `ESC-2026-02-08-001.md` or any other naming scheme. The `attest-escalation-` prefix is required for `/attest:status` to find and parse the file.

### 7. Present the record

Display the escalation record in the session. Confirm:

> Escalation record saved to: [full file path]
> Share this file with [suggested target role] for resolution.
> When resolved, run `/attest:resolve [filename]` to close this escalation.

## Multiple escalations

If multiple items are escalated during a single review, create a separate escalation record for each. Each gets its own file and resolution lifecycle.
