# Decision Logging

## Purpose

Decision logs are the audit artefact. They evidence that a human professional reviewed an AI-generated output, what questions were considered, what the reviewer decided on each point, and what the overall determination was. A decision log must be readable by someone who has never used Attest and has no access to the original session.

## Mandatory Fields

Every decision log must contain all of the following:

1. **Review date and time** — ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM) in the reviewer's local timezone
2. **Output type** — What kind of output was reviewed (e.g., contract review, policy draft, financial analysis)
3. **Source** — Which plugin or Claude capability produced the output, if identifiable
4. **Output fingerprint** — See Fingerprint Format below
5. **Risk classification** — The risk level assigned (and whether it was the suggested level or a reviewer override)
6. **Reviewer identity** — Name and role of the reviewer (prompted during log generation)
7. **Question-by-question record** — For each review question:
   - The question that was asked
   - The reviewer's response (Confirmed / Flagged / Escalated / Not applicable)
   - Any free-text notes the reviewer added
8. **Summary of flagged items** — List of all items marked Flagged, with the reviewer's notes
9. **Summary of escalated items** — List of all items marked Escalated, with the reviewer's rationale
10. **Reviewer's overall decision** — One of: Approved for use / Approved with modifications / Rejected / Escalated
11. **Reviewer's sign-off statement** — Free text from the reviewer summarising their overall assessment
12. **Rubber-stamp acknowledgement** — If rubber-stamp detection was triggered, note that the reviewer was prompted and acknowledged the all-confirmed status
13. **Disclaimer footer** — The standard Attest disclaimer (see below)

## Fingerprint Format

The output fingerprint section contains:

```
**Output fingerprint**
- SHA-256: [full SHA-256 hash of the reviewed output content]
- First 200 characters: [first 200 characters of the reviewed output, preserving line breaks]
- Word count: [total word count]
- Review timestamp: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
```

The SHA-256 hash provides a forensic-grade identifier of the exact content reviewed. Any modification to the original output, however small, would produce a different hash. This allows future audit to confirm which specific output was reviewed, even if the original session is no longer available.

## Filename Format

```
attest-review-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-[output-type].md
```

- Date and time from the review timestamp
- Output type in kebab-case (e.g., `contract-review`, `policy-draft`, `financial-analysis`)
- Example: `attest-review-2026-02-15-14-30-contract-review.md`

Files are saved to the configured save location (set via `/attest:config`). If no location is configured, save to the current working directory.

## Language Rules for Decision Logs

The log records what the reviewer decided. It does not record what Attest recommended, because Attest does not recommend.

### Required framing

- "The reviewer confirmed that..."
- "The reviewer flagged [item] noting that..."
- "The reviewer escalated [item] because..."
- "The reviewer determined that..."
- "The reviewer's overall decision was..."

### Prohibited framing

- "Attest found that..."
- "Attest identified issues with..."
- "The review revealed that..."  (implies Attest revealed it)
- "Attest recommended..." (Attest never recommends)
- Any language suggesting Attest made a quality judgment

### Neutral framing for questions

- "The following question was surfaced for the reviewer's consideration: [question]"
- "Attest surfaced this item for review based on [brief rationale]"

## Rubber-Stamp Recording

If all items were marked Confirmed with no free-text notes, and the rubber-stamp detection prompt was triggered:

Include in the decision log under a "Review completeness" heading:

```
**Review completeness note:** All review items were confirmed without additional notes.
The reviewer was prompted to confirm this reflected a genuine review of each item.
The reviewer acknowledged this on [date/time].
```

If rubber-stamp detection was not triggered (because the reviewer added notes or used other response types), omit this section entirely.

## Disclaimer Footer

Every decision log ends with this exact text:

> ---
>
> *This decision log was generated by Attest (Ashby). Attest surfaced questions for the reviewer's consideration. All review decisions, assessments, and the final determination were made by the human reviewer named above. Attest does not provide legal, financial, or compliance advice and has made no quality judgment about the reviewed output.*

## Presentation

After generating the decision log file, also present the full log content in the session so the reviewer can read and verify it before closing.

## Data Handling Note

Decision logs are stored in the reviewer's configured save location. Attest does not transmit, copy, or process decision logs beyond writing the file. Organisations should apply their existing data classification and retention policies to decision log files.
