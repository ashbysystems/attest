# Escalation Framework

## Purpose

Escalation is for review items that exceed the current reviewer's authority or expertise. Attest helps structure the escalation by capturing the rationale, suggesting an appropriate target role, and producing a self-contained escalation record that can be shared with the target without requiring access to the original session.

## When to Suggest Escalation

Escalation is appropriate when:

- The review item involves a domain outside the reviewer's professional expertise
- The item has consequences that exceed the reviewer's decision-making authority
- The reviewer is uncertain and the stakes are high enough that uncertainty is not acceptable
- The output makes claims in a regulated area that requires qualified sign-off
- The item involves organisational commitments (financial, contractual, reputational) above the reviewer's level

Attest does not force escalation. It surfaces the option. The reviewer decides.

For Critical and High risk outputs, the review-methodology skill requires prompting the reviewer to consider escalation. For Medium and Low risk outputs, escalation is available but not prompted.

## Escalation Target Roles

When an item is escalated, suggest an appropriate role based on the domain. These are role suggestions, not named individuals. The reviewer identifies the specific person.

| Domain | Suggested Escalation Target |
|--------|----------------------------|
| Legal / contractual | Senior legal counsel or head of legal |
| Data protection / privacy | Data Protection Officer (DPO) |
| Financial / commercial | CFO or head of finance |
| Regulatory / compliance | Compliance lead or regulatory affairs manager |
| Policy / governance | Senior policy lead or head of governance |
| Technical / security | CTO, CISO, or head of engineering |
| Procurement / vendor | Head of procurement |
| HR / employment | Head of HR or employment law specialist |
| Health / safety | Health and safety lead |
| General / unclear | The reviewer's line manager or department head |

If the domain does not clearly match any category, suggest the reviewer's line manager or the person who would normally approve this type of work.

## Suggested Timeframes

Suggest resolution timeframes based on the risk level of the escalated item:

| Risk Level | Suggested Timeframe | Rationale |
|------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Critical | Immediate (within hours) | Direct impact on legal rights, financial commitments, or regulatory compliance |
| High | Within 24 hours | Significant decision impact or external-facing consequences |
| Medium | Within 1 week | Internal decision support, no immediate external consequence |
| Low | At next convenience | Low stakes, resolution is for completeness |

These are suggestions. The reviewer sets the actual timeframe based on their organisational context.

## Escalation Record Format

Each escalation produces a self-contained markdown file with:

1. **Escalation metadata**
   - Escalation date and time
   - Related review log filename (for cross-reference)
   - Escalated by (reviewer name and role)
   - Risk level of the reviewed output

2. **Context**
   - Output type and source
   - Output fingerprint (same as decision log)
   - Brief description of the reviewed output (2-3 sentences of context so the escalation target understands what was reviewed)

3. **Escalated item**
   - The specific review question that was escalated
   - Why this question was surfaced (brief rationale from Attest)

4. **Reviewer's escalation rationale**
   - Why the reviewer is escalating (free text, captured during escalation)

5. **Suggested target**
   - Suggested role for resolution
   - Suggested timeframe for resolution

6. **Resolution section** (blank until resolved via `/attest:resolve`)
   - Resolved by (name and role)
   - Resolution date and time
   - Decision
   - Conditions or follow-up actions
   - Resolution notes

7. **Disclaimer footer** — Same disclaimer as decision logs:

## Escalation Filename Format

```
attest-escalation-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-[item-ref].md
```

- Date and time from the escalation timestamp
- Item reference is a short kebab-case label derived from the escalated question topic (e.g., `liability-cap`, `data-processing`, `jurisdiction`)
- Example: `attest-escalation-2026-02-15-14-45-liability-cap.md`

## Resolution Recording

When `/attest:resolve` is used to close an escalation:

1. Read the specified escalation record file
2. Prompt for:
   - Who resolved it (name and role)
   - What was decided (free text)
   - Any conditions or follow-up actions
3. Populate the Resolution section of the escalation record
4. Add the resolution date and time
5. Mark the record as resolved

The resolution is appended to the existing file, preserving the full audit trail. The original escalation content is never modified.

## Multiple Escalations

A single review can produce multiple escalation records if the reviewer escalates more than one item. Each escalated item gets its own file with its own resolution lifecycle.

The decision log references all escalation records by filename. `/attest:status` tracks all open and resolved escalations.
